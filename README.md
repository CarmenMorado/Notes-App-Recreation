# Notes-App-Recreation
100 Days of Swift (Milestone Project 7) Recreation of the iOS Notes app.
Your challenge for this milestone is to use those API to imitate Apple as closely as you can: I’d like you to recreate the iOS Notes app. I suggest you follow the iPhone version, because it’s fairly simple: a navigation controller, a table view controller, and a detail view controller with a full-screen text view. How much of the app you imitate is down to you, but I suggest you work through this list:

-Create a table view controller that lists notes. Place it inside a navigation controller. (Project 1)


-Tapping on a note should slide in a detail view controller that contains a full-screen text view. (Project 19)


-Notes should be loaded and saved using Codable. You can use UserDefaults if you want, or write to a file. (Project 12)


-Add some toolbar items to the detail view controller – “delete” and “compose” seem like good choices. (Project 4)


-Add an action button to the navigation bar in the detail view controller that shares the text using UIActivityViewController. (Project 3)


Once you’ve done those, try using Interface Builder to customize the UI – how close can you make it look like Notes?
Note: the official Apple Notes app supports rich text input and media; don’t worry about that, focus on plain text.
